// Key takeaways:
// When we read user input via io:stdin(), in read_line, we always use the address
// of mutable variable that we are passing.

// When using match statement, if matching string, we need to trim the string, since the user presses
// enter to proceed, and that is taken as a character in Rust. trim() functio helps get rid of
// such characters

// In match clauses, it is important to handle the `_` match case, which implies that the user
// input has not matched any value and thus the message from `_` case will be printed out

// When shadowing a variable, we need to mention it's type. This can most likely be when we take
// an input from the user as String::new(), and want to cast it to an int or float. In this case
// of shadowing, it is important that we mention the type of the new shadow variable that we are
// creating.

// When doing arithmetic with floats and ints, if there is a float, then the ints should also be
// floats by default, and this can be done by adding a `.` at the end of int values.
